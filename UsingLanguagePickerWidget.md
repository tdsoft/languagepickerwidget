# Instructions #

Because this is a widget, you won't see it on the applications launcher, so to use this app, you need to add it to the home screen. Do as follows:

1. While on a home screen with an empty space, press the menu button and press add:

Select Widgets:

Select Language Picker widget:

You have successfully setup the widget. You can add as many widgets as you want:

Now, to change languages, just press one of the widgets.

# Note #

This widget changes the language of the phone, which means that all the widgets that lie on the home screen will have to reload, and if you have widgets that require access to the Internet, these will try to reload, in many cases going to the Internet to update their information. This might seem like this app is slow, however this is a perfectly normal behavior of Android when one changes the language of the device.


# Note for developers #

I should have posted this instructions when I released the application, because all of the bad reviews come from people that do not know how why this application does not appear on the applications launcher. So if you are a developer, make sure that it is clear how the application works for all your user base.
