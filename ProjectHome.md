An Android Widget to change locales on one click.

This is a widget, so it is not available in the applications launcher, but has to be added to the home screen, see the Instructions to add this widget to the home screen in the wiki:
https://code.google.com/p/languagepickerwidget/wiki/UsingLanguagePickerWidget

If you write SMS, emails or any other type of text in multiple languages and your Android device contains the dictionary (autocorrect/suggestions) on those languages, then you can take advantage of this widget to change the device language/locale right before composing the text.

This application was born because you can't change the language you are typing in text using the Android keyboard (at least the official one).

You can install it from the Market:

# Note #


This widget changes the language of the phone, which means that all the widgets that lie on the home screen will have to reload, and if you have widgets that require access to the Internet, these will try to reload, in many cases going to the Internet to update their information. This might seem like this app is slow, however this is a perfectly normal behavior of Android when one changes the language of the device.
